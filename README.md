# ManishSolanki
Here I Share My Projects. 

My name is Manish Solanki, and I am currently learning Python programming. I made this project for practice, taking inspiration from many sources. I have added basic calculators to it, including an Average Calculator and a Multiplication Table Calculator, which can also generate multiplication tables for float numbers. It took me 10 to 15 days to complete this project, and I learned a lot in the process. If you find it useful, do give it a try.
